Git --> Git is a version control system that help us to track the changes in the code ..

Exmaple in our banking system we have track ofa ll the detial like ,how much money is credited ion our bank account , how much tax we have to pay
same as it is git is used to mentain the code and track the code...

git hub --> Git hub is the website that that help the developer to mentain and store the code.

https://github.com


Create a git repositry , by default it was with a readMe.md file which contain the realtive information regards the project.



--- Open git bash and config your name and email----

git config --global user.name "Aaryan sharma"  //This is how we config our name...

git config --global user.email "aaryansharma0575@gmail.com"  //This is how we config our email...

git config --list //Used to get all the details of the entered location....




CLONE  (When we create the repo on git hub then use it)

git clone 'https://github.com/aaryansharmaaa/practice-git.git'   //Used to clone the repo from globar to local machine...

ls //Used to list all the files in the git....

ls -a //Used to get all the hidden files...

git status //Used to get the status of all folder in git.....

git add . //Used to add the file...

git commit -m "Comment" ///Used to comit....on the local machine

git push origin main //Used to push the code on the remote machine (on git hub)....



INIT (When we start the project on our local machine and then create a repo for it how to do it)


git init //Inetlize the git...

git remote add origin link  //Adding the origin link.....

git remote -v //Verify the remote branch....

git branch // Check in which branch it was...

git branch -M main //Shift to the main branch....

git push -u origin main //Push the code on the main origin....


Branch --> Used to divide the whole application in branches.

git branch //Used to check in which branch we are ...

git branch -M main //Used to change the branch name..

git checkout nameofbranch //Used to checkout from branch in git...

git checkout -b newBranchName //Used to create new branch...

git branch -d branchaneme  //Used to delete the branch...

git diff branch //Used to tell the differenece between two branch...[when we merg two branch].

git merg branchName //Used to merg two branch...

But we can create a pull request to merg branches in our code.[but it chnge only on remote repo not in loclea]

git pull origin main //After creating the pull request then run this comand...

pull request used to download all the content from remote repo to local repo....

 Merge conflict are those conflict that occure when we add feature in the same place in same file in twol different branch.
[we are not able to resolve the differenece bw two branch].



UNDOING CHANGES.

git reset filename //if we add the changes but dont commit them than it can be undo with it...

git reset HEAD~1 //if we commit the change then we can undo it with the help of it...

git log //Used to check all the logs means ,What aer the cahnges we made we going to chech with it...

git reset hashCode //If we want to reset the perticular log then use this...

git rest --hard hashCode // It will change the code from both the remote and online origin...
